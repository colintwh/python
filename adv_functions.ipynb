    "What would happen if we omitted those conditions from our function? When we got to n = 2, we would keep calling the function, trying to calculate `fibonacci(0)`, `fibonacci(-1)`, and so on. In theory, the function would end up recursing forever and never terminate, but in practice the program will crash with a RuntimeError and a message that we have exceeded the maximum recursion depth. This is because Python’s stack has a finite size – if we keep placing instances of the function on the stack we will eventually fill it up and cause a **stack overflow**. Python protects itself from stack overflows by setting a limit on the number of times that a function is allowed to recurse.\n",

    "Writing fail-safe recursive function is hard. What if we called the function above with a parameter of -1? We haven’t included any error checking which guards against this, so we would skip over the end cases and try to calculate fibonacci(-2), fibonacci(-3), and keep going.\n",
