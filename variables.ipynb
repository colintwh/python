    "   + Trying to access the value of a variable which **hasn't been defined anywhere yet** will result in a **name error**.\n",
    "   + Variables names can contain only **letters**, **numbers**, and **underscores**. They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number. For example, *message_1* is acceptable but not *1_message*.\n",
    "   + **Spaces are not allowed** in variable names, but **underscores can be used** to separate words in variable names. For instance, *greeting_message*.\n",
    "   + Avoid using Python keywords and function names. There are words that Python has reserved for a particular programmatic purpose, such as the word *print*.\n",
    "   + Variable names should be short but descriptive. For example, *name* vs *n*; *name_length* as opposed to *length_of_persons_name*.\n",
    "   + Be careful when using the lowercase letter *l* and the uppercase letter *O* - they can be confused with the numbers *1* and *0*."

It is accessible from the point at which it is defined until the end of the function, and exists for as long as the function is executing. The parameter names in the function definition behave like local variables, but they contain the values that we pass into the function when we call it. When we use the assignment operator `=` inside a function, its default behaviour is to create a new local variable – unless a variable with the same name is already defined in the local scope."
