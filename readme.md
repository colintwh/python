# Python

## Aim

   Learn/recall the basics of Python - the preferred programming language for Data Science.

   You'll need an IDE such as Spyder or Jupyter Notebook to work with your Python programs.

## Python versions

Python underwent a major version change from 2 to 3. Though Python 2 is still widely used, Python 3 is not fully backwards compatible the two versions are very similar. The code in the notebooks should run on Python 3.6 or later. 

## Python on different Operating Systems

Python is cross-platform, i.e. it runs on all major operating systems - Windows, macOS and Linux. To check the version of Python installed, open a command (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux) window and enter `python` or `python3`. You should see output indicating Python version and a`>>>` prompt where you can start entering Python commands:

```
    Python 3.7.6 (default, Jan 8, 2020, 19:59:22)
    [GCC 7.3.0] on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information
    >>>
```

## Running programs from files

Python files are commonly given the suffix .py. Once you have written a program and saved it, you can run it by using the python command with the file name as a parameter:

    python hello_world.py

### Installing new packages

The [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/) is a large repository of Python packages. You can install packages using a tool like `conda install` or `pip`. Both of these utilities are cross-platform. Here is how you install a package called sqlobject with pip:

    pip install sqlobject


## Topics:

The basic concepts you'll need to do analytics operations in Python are organised in the following chapters

   1. [Introduction to Python](https://github.com/colintwh/python-basics/blob/master/introtopython.ipynb)
   2. [Functions](https://github.com/colintwh/python-basics/blob/master/functions.ipynb)
   3. [Booleans and Conditionals](https://github.com/colintwh/python-basics/blob/master/conditionals.ipynb)
