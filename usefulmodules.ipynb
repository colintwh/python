    "\n",
    "Python comes with a built-in selection of modules which provide commonly used functionality. We will look at a few examples here. This is only a brief overview of a small subset of the available modules – you can check out the [Python Standard Library documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/index.html) for more details.\n",

    "The datetime module provides us with objects which we can use to store information about dates and times:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ `datetime.date` is used to create dates which are not associated with a time.\n",
    "+ `datetime.time` is used for times which are independent of a date.\n",
    "+ `datetime.datetime` is used for objects which have both a date and a time.\n",
    "+ `datetime.timedelta` objects store differences between dates or datetimes – if we subtract one datetime from another, the result will be a `timedelta`.\n",
    "+ `datetime.timezone` objects represent time zone adjustments as offsets from UTC. This class is a subclass of `datetime.tzinfo`, which is not meant to be used directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can query these objects for a particular component (like the year, month, hour or minute), perform arithmetic on them, and extract printable string versions from them if we need to display them. Here are a few examples:"
