    "When we run a program on the commandline, we often want to pass in parameters, or arguments, just as we would pass parameters to a function inside our code. Unlike parameters passed to a function in Python, arguments passed to an application on the commandline are separated by spaces and listed after the program name without any brackets.\n",

    "The simplest way to access commandline arguments inside a script is through the `sys` module. All the arguments in order are stored in the module’s `argv` attribute. We must remember that the first argument is always the name of the script file, and that all the arguments will be provided in string format. Try saving this simple script and calling it with various arguments after the script name:"

    "The `argparse` module allows us to define a wide range of compulsory and optional arguments. A commonly used type of argument is the flag, which we can think of as equivalent to a keyword argument in Python. A flag is optional, it has a name (sometimes both a long name and a short name) and it may have a value. In Linux and OSX programs, flag names often start with a dash (long names usually start with two), and this convention is sometimes followed by Windows programs too.\n",
